# üíª Only for developers

## üå± Installation

### Prerequisites
- ***Node v18 or higher***.

### How install
The ***all-in-one*** script to install and launch in development mode is defined <a href="#all-in-one-script-included-installation">below</a>. But you can install front and back separately:
  ```
  $ cd front
  $ npm install

  $ cd ../back
  $ npm install
  ```

## üöÄ Getting started

### Development mode
#### All-in-one script (included installation)
To launch the dev mode, you can launch the all-in-one script called 'wakeup.sh'.
This script launches the front and back projects together.
```
$ ./wakeup.sh
```

#### Separately
You can launch back and front separately.
  ```
  $ cd front
  $ npm run dev

  $ cd ../back
  $ npm run start
  ```

#### View the project
Finally, you can open the frontend with your browser: `localhost:8000`.
The backend will be listening in `localhost:3000`.

---

## Production mode

### Front:
```
$ cd front
$ npm run build
```

### Library:
```
$ cd lib
$ npm run build
```
Note: You may want to publish a new version of the package (in <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/registry">npm public registry</a>) and then install it in the front dependencies.
```
$ npm version X.X.X
$ npm publish
```

### Back:
Build process is not necessary. Only deploy the last version of back on your favorite server.
We uses <a href="https://railway.app/">Railway</a> but you can use whatever.

#### Different environments
There are more instructions to generate differente API environment inside the subfolder [/back/README.md](./back/README.md).

#### API URL

# üí° Idea
This project is an experiment to test the capabilities of canvas. It also serves as a challenge to practice using vanilla JS without the need for frameworks like React or Vue.

This project started like almost all of them: with pencil and paper.
