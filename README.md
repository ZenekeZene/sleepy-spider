# üíª Only for developers

## üå± Installation

### Prerequisites
- ***NVM installed***. You can follow the next instructions: (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
- ***Node v18 or higher***. If you had installed NVM, you can switch your Node version with:
  ```
  $ nvm use 18
  ```
  You can view your current node version with:
  ```
  $ node -v
  ```

### How install
The ***all-in-one*** script to install and launch in development mode is defined above. But you can install front and back separately:
  ```
  $ cd front
  $ npm install

  $ cd ../back
  $ npm install
  ```

## üöÄ Getting started

### Development mode
#### All-in-one script (included installation)
To launch the dev mode, you can launch the all-in-one script called 'wakeup.sh'.
This script launches the front and back projects together.
```
$ ./wakeup.sh
```
***Note:*** Maybe you dont have permissions to launch this script as a program. In these case, you have to give permissions:
```
chmod +x ./wakeup.sh
```

#### Separately
You can launch back and front separately.
  ```
  $ cd front
  $ npm run dev

  $ cd ../back
  $ npm run start
  ```

#### View the project
Finally, you can open the frontend with your browser: `localhost:8000`.
The backend will be listening in `localhost:3000`.

# üí° Idea
This project is an experiment to test the capabilities of canvas. It also serves as a challenge to practice using vanilla JS without the need for frameworks like React or Vue.

This project started like almost all of them: with pencil and paper.
